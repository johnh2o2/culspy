Jan 20, 2016 -- John Hoffman

Modified code from original form to comply with
the latest CUDA standards. For instance, the original
Makefile referenced "common.mk". On my Ubuntu 14.04
system, I do not have a common.mk file anywhere.

Also added a couple of test files (a testlc file, etc.)

Might want to add a couple of things for timing as well!
